Quiz. While loop in matlab ?
âœ… while Loop in MATLAB:
The while loop is a repetition structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop stops.
ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax:
while condition
 		   % Code to be executed while condition is true
end
1.	Condition: As long as this condition remains true, the code inside the loop will execute.
2.	Code Execution: The code within the while block will be repeatedly executed until the condition becomes false.
ðŸ”¹ Flowchart:
[Check condition] ---> True ---> [Execute Code] ---> [Recheck Condition]
                 \
                False
                    \
             [Exit loop]
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Simple while Loop

x = 1;

while x <= 5
    disp(['x = ' num2str(x)]);
    x = x + 1;  % Increment x by 1
end

Explanation:
1.	Initial Condition: x = 1
2.	Condition Check: The condition x <= 5 is true, so the loop starts.
3.	Code Execution:
o	disp(['x = ' num2str(x)]) prints the value of x.
o	x = x + 1; increments x by 1.
4.	Once x = 6, the condition x <= 5 becomes false, and the loop stops.
Output:
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Infinite while Loop
If the condition never becomes false, the loop becomes infinite.
x = 1;

while true
    disp(['x = ' num2str(x)]);
    x = x + 1;
    if x > 5
        break;  % Exit the infinite loop
    end
end
Explanation:
1.	Condition: while true means the loop will run indefinitely (since true is always true).
2.	Code Execution: In each iteration, the value of x is displayed, and x is incremented.
3.	Break Condition: When x > 5, the break statement will exit the loop.
Output:
x = 1
x = 2
x = 3
x = 4
x = 5
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 3: while Loop with User Input
userInput = 0;

while userInput ~= 10
    userInput = input('Enter a number (enter 10 to stop): ');
    disp(['You entered: ' num2str(userInput)]);
end

disp('You entered 10, loop stopped.');
Explanation:
1.	Initial Condition: userInput = 0
2.	Condition: while userInput ~= 10 means the loop will run until the user enters 10.
3.	User Input: The input() function takes user input, and the condition is checked.
4.	The loop will stop once the user enters 10.
Output (Example):
Enter a number (enter 10 to stop): 5
You entered: 5
Enter a number (enter 10 to stop): 7
You entered: 7
Enter a number (enter 10 to stop): 10
You entered: 10
You entered 10, loop stopped.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Important Points to Remember:
1.	Infinite Loops: If the condition never becomes false, the loop will continue infinitely. This can happen if the condition is always true, like while true.
2.	Break the Infinite Loop: To stop an infinite loop in MATLAB, you can press Ctrl + C.
3.	Condition Change: Make sure to modify the condition or variables inside the loop, otherwise, the loop will never terminate.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ while Loop with Multiple Conditions:
You can check multiple conditions using logical operators like && (AND) and || (OR).
x = 0;

while x < 10 && mod(x, 2) == 0
    disp(['x = ' num2str(x)]);
    x = x + 1;
end
Explanation:
â€¢	Condition: x < 10 && mod(x, 2) == 0 ensures that x is both less than 10 and an even number.
________________________________________
âœ… Conclusion:
â€¢	The while loop is a powerful control structure that allows you to execute code repeatedly as long as a condition remains true.
â€¢	You can use while loops for infinite loops, user-driven inputs, and complex conditions.
â€¢	You can exit the loop early with the break statement when the condition is met.

QUIZ. IF ELSE IN MATLAB 

âœ… if-else in MATLAB:
The if-else statement is used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. It's one of the most fundamental control structures in programming.
ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax:
if condition
    % Code to execute if condition is true
elseif another_condition
    % Code to execute if the second condition is true
else
    % Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
end
1.	if condition: Checks if the condition is true. If so, the code inside the if block is executed.
2.	elseif another_condition: If the first condition is false, MATLAB checks for this new condition. If it's true, the code inside the elseif block is executed.
3.	else: If all conditions are false, the code inside the else block is executed.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Basic if-else Statement
x = 5;

if x > 0
    disp('x is positive');
else
    disp('x is not positive');
end
Explanation:
â€¢	The condition x > 0 is true, so the first block inside if is executed.
â€¢	The output will be x is positive.
Output:
x is positive
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Using elseif
You can use multiple conditions to check for different possibilities.
x = -3;

if x > 0
    disp('x is positive');
elseif x == 0
    disp('x is zero');
else
    disp('x is negative');
end
Explanation:
â€¢	The condition x > 0 is false, so MATLAB moves to the elseif.
â€¢	The condition x == 0 is also false, so the else block is executed, printing x is negative.
Output:
x is negative
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 3: Nested if-else
You can also nest if-else statements within each other.
x = 5;
y = 3;

if x > 0
    if y > 0
        disp('Both x and y are positive');
    else
        disp('x is positive, but y is not');
    end
else
    disp('x is not positive');
end
Explanation:
â€¢	The first condition x > 0 is true, so MATLAB enters the inner if statement.
â€¢	The inner condition y > 0 is also true, so the message Both x and y are positive is displayed.
Output:
Both x and y are positive
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 4: if-else with Logical Operators
You can use logical operators like && (AND) and || (OR) to combine multiple conditions.
x = 8;
y = 12;

if x > 0 && y > 0
    disp('Both x and y are positive');
elseif x <= 0 || y <= 0
    disp('At least one of x or y is non-positive');
else
    disp('Unknown case');
end
Explanation:
â€¢	The first condition x > 0 && y > 0 is true, so the message Both x and y are positive will be displayed.
Output:
Both x and y are positive
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Example 5: if-else with else as the default:
Sometimes you just want a default behavior if the conditions are not met.
x = 0;

if x > 0
    disp('x is positive');
elseif x < 0
    disp('x is negative');
else
    disp('x is zero');
end
Explanation:
â€¢	The condition x > 0 is false, so it checks x < 0 (also false), and finally, the else block executes, printing x is zero.
Output:
x is zero
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Important Points:
1.	Multiple elseif: You can have multiple elseif blocks to check different conditions one after the other.
2.	else Block: The else block will only execute if all previous conditions are false.
3.	Nested if: You can nest if statements within each other to check for more complex conditions.
4.	Logical Operators: Combine conditions using && (AND), || (OR), and ~ (NOT) to form complex logical tests.
5.	Avoid Redundant Conditions: If you have multiple elseif conditions, make sure they are mutually exclusive (they shouldn't overlap).
________________________________________
âœ… Conclusion:
â€¢	if-else is a fundamental control structure used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.
â€¢	You can use multiple conditions with elseif, and you can even nest conditions to handle more complex logic.
â€¢	It's helpful for tasks where you need to handle different scenarios based on values or conditions.

Quiz.   WHAT IS COMPUTER ?

Components of Computer Components of a Computer Here are the main components of the computer: 
1.Input Unit: The input unit consists of input devices that are attached to the computer. These devices take input and convert it into binary language that the computer understands. Some of the common input devices are keyboard, mouse, joystick, scanner etc.
 The Input Unit is formed by attaching one or more input devices to a computer. A user input data and instructions through input devices such as a keyboard, mouse, etc. The input unit is used to provide data to the processor for further processing. 
2. Central Processing Unit: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer because it controls everything the computer does. When you enter information using an input device, the CPU processes it. First, it fetches instructions from memory, then decodes them to understand what needs to be done. If needed, it retrieves data from memory or an input device. After that, the CPU executes the task and either stores the result or displays it on an output device. 
The CPU has three main parts: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which handles calculations and logic; 
the Control Unit (CU), which directs operations; and Memory Registers, which store temporary data. 
A.	Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): The ALU, as its name suggests performs mathematical calculations and takes logical decisions. Arithmetic calculations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Logical decisions involve the comparison of two data items to see which one is larger or smaller or equal. Arithmetic Logical Unit is the main component of the CPU It is the fundamental building block of the CPU. Arithmetic and Logical Unit is a digital circuit that is used to perform arithmetic and logical operations. 
B.	Control Unit: The Control unit coordinates and controls the data f low in and out of the CPU, and also controls all the operations of ALU, memory registers and also input/output units. It is also responsible for carrying out all the instructions stored in the program. It decodes the fetched instruction, interprets it and sends control signals to input/output devices until the required operation is done properly by ALU and memory.
The Control Unit is a component of the central processing unit of a com puter that directs the operation of the processor. It instructs the computerâ€™s memory, arithmetic and logic unit, and input and output devices on how to respond to the processorâ€™s instructions. In order to execute the instructions, the components of a computer receive signals from the control unit. It is also called the central nervous system or brain of the computer. 
C.	Memory Registers: A register is a small, temporary memory inside the CPU. The processor uses it to store data that it is currently working on. Registers come in different sizes, such as 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit, and each has a specific role. Some store data, some store instructions, and others hold memory addresses. For example, the Accumulator (ACC) is an important register in the CPU. It holds one of the values used in calculations inside the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU). Apart from registers, the internal memory (also called primary memory or main memory) is where data and instructions are stored temporarily while a program runs. This memory is called RAM (Random Access Memory). Every piece of data in RAM is stored at a unique location with an address, so the processor can access it quickly without searching the entire memory. Since RAM provides direct access to any data location, it is called Random Access Memory.
 Memory Unit is the primary storage of the computer. 
1. It stores both data and instructions. 
2. Data and instructions are stored permanently in this unit so that they are available whenever required.
3.Output Unit : The output unit consists of output devices that are attached to the computer. It converts the binary data coming from the CPU to human understandable form. The common output devices are monitor, printer, plotter, etc. The output unit displays or prints the processed data in a user-friendly format. The output unit is formed by attaching the output devices of a com puter. The output unit accepts the information from the CPU and displays it in a user-readable form. 
4. Motherboard: The motherboard is like the backbone of a computer, connecting all the important parts such as the CPU, memory, and storage. It also helps distribute power, transfer information, and connect devices like a mouse, keyboard, or monitor. If there is a problem with the motherboard, a computer technician may open the PC to check for any loose or damaged connections, such as corrosion. They may also inspect the power supply to ensure the computer is receiving electricity properly. 
5. Random Access Memory (RAM): RAM is the computerâ€™s short term memory, where data is stored temporarily while programs are running. For example, when you open an app, it loads into RAM so the computer can access it quickly. A technician knows how to check what type of RAM a computer has, replace it if itâ€™s faulty, and fix issues with moving data in memory. They also understand different types of RAM and common problems that can affect it. Before repairing RAM, a technician might back up important files to prevent losing any important programs or documents.
6. Power Supply Unit (PSU): The Power Supply Unit (PSU) gives electricity to all the parts of a computer. It usually connects the PC to a wall socket using a power cord. If thereâ€™s a problem, a technician may check by turning off the computer, unplugging the power cord, or trying a different cord or outlet to see if the issue is with the power supply. 
Characteristics of a Computer 
Speed: Computers can perform millions of calculations per second. The computation speed is extremely fast. 
Accuracy: Because computers operate on pre-programmed software, there is no space for human error. 
Diligence: They can perform complex and long calculations at the same time and with the same accuracy. 
Versatile: Computers are designed to be versatile. They can carry out multiple operations at the same time.
 Storage: Computers can store a large amount of data/ instructions in its memory, which can be retrieved at any point of time. 

Conclusion Computer have been there for many years and and its use have been spread widely. Three important component of Computer are Input Unit, CPU and Output Unit. But there are some other components like Memory Unit, Control unit and Arithmetic and Logical unit. Using this all components we can easily do complex operations.

Quiz. Matrix elements sorting in ascending order ??

To sort all elements of a matrix in ascending order in MATLAB, you can use the following approach:
................................................................................................
% Define the matrix
A = [3 1 4; 2 5 6; 9 7 8];

% Flatten the matrix into a single column vector
B = A(:);

% Sort the vector in ascending order
sorted_B = sort(B);

% Reshape back to the original matrix size (if desired)
sorted_matrix = reshape(sorted_B, size(A));
.................................................................................................
This code performs the following steps:

Flattening: Converts the matrix A into a column vector B using A(:).

Sorting: Sorts the elements of B in ascending order using sort(B).

Reshaping: Reshapes the sorted vector back to the original matrix dimensions with reshape(sorted_B, size(A)).

If you prefer to sort each row or column individually, MATLAB's sort function can be used directly:

Sort each column in ascending order:
....................................................................................................
sorted_columns = sort(A);
.....................................................................................................
Sort each row in ascending order:
........................................................
sorted_rows = sort(A, 2);
........................................................

Quiz. SINE WAVE GRAPH 
............................................................
% Define parameters
f = 5;             % Frequency in Hz
A = 1;             % Amplitude
phi = 0;           % Phase shift in radians
Fs = 1000;         % Sampling frequency in Hz
t = 0:1/Fs:1;      % Time vector from 0 to 1 second

% Generate sine wave
y = A * sin(2 * pi * f * t + phi);

% Plot the sine wave
plot(t, y);
title('Sine Wave');
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Amplitude');
grid on;
.............................................................

This script defines a sine wave with a frequency of 5 Hz, amplitude of 1, and no phase shift. It samples the wave at 1000 Hz over a duration of 1 second. 
The plot function then visualizes the sine wave over time.
